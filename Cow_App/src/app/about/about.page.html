    <p>
      At <strong>Farmware</strong>, we understand the vital role that healthy livestock plays in the livelihood of farmers.
      That’s why we’ve created a smart, user-friendly mobile application designed to assist farmers with managing and monitoring the health of their cows.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is simple: to empower farmers with the tools and knowledge they need to ensure the well-being of their animals.
      We believe that by providing accurate, timely, and actionable insights, we can help farmers prevent diseases, enhance productivity, and ultimately improve their livelihoods.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do?</h2>
    <p>
      Farmware offers a comprehensive solution for livestock health management.
      Our app allows farmers to log daily health data for each cow, predict potential diseases through early symptoms, and receive tailored recommendations for treatments and precautions.
      With our adaptive questionnaire system, the app evolves with each entry, ensuring that the advice given is both relevant and precise.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Farmware?</h2>
    <p>
      Farmware is tailored to meet the unique challenges faced by farmers, focusing on local cow breeds and common regional diseases.
      The app is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing farmers to focus on their livestock. By tracking health data and predicting potential issues before they become serious,
      Farmware helps farmers take preventive measures, reducing the need for costly treatments and minimizing loss. Beyond just an app,
      Farmware supports farmers with training and resources to maximize its benefits.
